We are all well as usual except Mother1 is not quite as well as common. Our family is small and yet I have a great deal of business to see to, Brother Tenny2 has not moved yet, and he does not know when he will, we have taken possession of all the room we could get. I have got all the money that I have had any chance to, and as many goods as I could well, I have not got much at Chester,3 no money at all, there is so many a watching that place that there is no prospect of my getting any thing of consequence there.4 Brother Knights5 will tell you better about the business than I can write, as there is but a moment for me to improve. I cannot tell you my feelings when I found I could not see you before you left,6 yet I expect you can realize them, the children7 feel very anxious about you because they dont know where you have gone; I verily feel that if I had no more confidence in God than some I could name, I should be in a sad case indeed but I still believe that if we humble ourselves, and are <​as​> faithful as we can be we shall be delivered from every snare that may be laid for our feet, and our lives and property will be saved and we redeemed from all unreasonable encumbrances. My time is out, I pray that God will keep you in purity and safety till we all meet again. Emma Smith'

      content: 'Kirtland May 3rd 1837 Ever affectionate husband, myself and the children are well Father and Mother are not very well, tho not dangerous.1 I do not know what to tell you, not having but a few minutes to write, the situation of your business is such as is very difficult for me to do any thing of any consequence, partnership matters give every body such an unaccountable right to every particle of property or money that they can lay their hands on,2 that there is no prospect of my getting one dollar of current money3 or even get the grain you left for our bread, as I sent to the French place4 for that wheat and brother Strong5 says that he shall let us only have ten bushel, he has sold the hay and keeps the money. Dr [Warren A.] Cowdery tells me he can’t get money to pay the postage of the office. I spoke to Parish [Warren Parrish] about the money, and he appeared rather indifferent [p. 35] and stiff,6 and only observed that it was the opinion of the people, that Sharp7 did not intend ever to pay that money. brother Parish has been very anxious to for some time past to get the little mare, and I do not know but it would be your will to have him have her, but I have been so treated that I have come to the determination not to let any man or woman have any thing whatever without being well assured, that it goes to your own advantage, but it is impossible for me to do any thing, as long as every body has so much better right to all that is called yours than I have. Brother Holmes8 went directly to keeping house. Brother Tenny9 has not moved yet nor does not act much like it. I do not know every thing by considerable, but it is my anxiety for your company at home, or else it is realy so that your matters would and things would be much bettered by your presence just as soon as consistant, it is impossible for me to write what I wish you to know. If you should write after you get this, I want you to let me know as much as possible about the situation of your business, that if possible I can benefit by the information;10 And speak some word of encouragement to Hervey [Lyman Hervy Cowdery],11 for he is very faithful not only in business, but in taking up his cross in the family. There was a young man came with Brother Baldwin12 and Father’s folks took him in while br B was gone and he is here <​yet and is​> very sick with the measles which makes much confusion and trouble for me, and is also a subject of much fear and anxiety unto me, as you know that neither of your little one boys have ever had them,13 I wish it could be possible for you to be at home when they are sick, you must remember them for they all remember you, and I could hardly pacify Julia and Joseph when they found ou[t] you was not coming home soon. Br Robinson14 must the rest as he is waiting so adieu my Dear— Joseph. Emma. P.S If you should give anyone a power of attorney, you had better give it to brother [Vinson] Knight, as he is the only man that has not manifested a spirit of indifference to your temporal interest. I mean the only one I have had occasion to say muct [much] to about your business. You may be astonished because I have not accepted some but when I see you I will tell you the reason—, be assured I shall do the best I can in all things, and I hope that we shall be so humble and pure before God that he will set us at liberty to be our own masters in a few things at least, Yours for ever.

      content: 'Quincy March 7th Dear Husband Having an opportunity to send by a friend I make an attempt to write, but I shall not attempt to write my feelings altogether, for the situation in which you are, the walls, bars, and bolts, rolling rivers, running streams, rising hills, sinking vallies and spreading prairies that separate us, and the cruel injustice that first cast you into prison and still holds you there,1 with many other considerations, places my feelings far beyond description. Was it not for conscious innocence, and the direct interposition of divine mercy, I am very sure I never should have been able to have endured the scenes of suffering that I have passed through, since what is called the Militia, came in to Far West, under the ever to be remembered Governor’s notable order; an order fraught with as much wickedness as ignorance and as much ignorance as was ever contained in an article of that length;2 but I still live and am yet willing to suffer more if it is the will of kind Heaven, that I should for your sake. We are all well at present, except Fredrick who is quite sick. Little Alexander who is now in my arms is one of the finest little fellows, you ever saw in your life, he is <​so​> strong that with the assistance of a chair he will run all round the room. I am now living at Judge [John] Cleveland’s four miles from the village of Quincy. I do not know how long I shall stay here. I want you to write an answer by the bearer. I left your change of clothes with H. C. Kimbal [Heber C. Kimball] when I came away, and he agreed to see that you had clean clothes as often as necessary.3 No one but God, knows the reflections of my mind and the feelings of my heart when I left our house and home, and allmost all of every thing that we possessed excepting our little Children, and took my journey out of the State of Missouri, leaving you shut up in jail that lonesome prison. But the reflection recollection is more than human nature ought to bear, and if God does not record our sufferings and avenge our wrongs on them that are guilty,4 I shall be sadly mistaken. The daily sufferings of our brethren in travelling and camping out nights, and those on the other side of the river would beggar the most lively description.5 The people in this state are very kind indeed, they are doing much more than we ever anticipated they would;6 I have many more things I could like to write but have not time and you may be astonished at my bad writing and incoherent manner, but you will pardon all when you reflect how hard it would be for you to write, when your hands were stiffened with hard work, and your heart convulsed with intense anxiety. But I hope there is better days to come to us yet, Give my respects to all in that place that you respect, and am ever your’s affectionately. Emma Smith'

Green[e] sent to Eben[e]zer Robinson containing the names of a number of subscribers he wants the letter on account of the names12 Fathers health has been remarkably good <​so​> untill today he is not so well as usual, Mother is well.13 I The disturbance between Gov [Lilburn W.] Boggs and the Iowa is still increasing, a sheriff of the Iowa crossed Skunk river at Col Wights [Lyman Wight’s] place this week with a Missourie Sheriff his prisoner who was take[n] while he was collecting his govenors taxes and from all the information we get there is three thousand Mo troops now on their march after him the mails are stoped and at the mouth of the Desmoin14 the Misourians retained the powder and lead that belonged to the merchants above them and sent the other goods as usual, this is all the information we can get on the subject yet and we have some serious impressions that it is true There is great anxiety manifest in this place for your prosperity and the time lingers long that you is set for your return, the day is is waning and night is approaching so fast that I must reserve my better feelings untill I have a better chance to express them.

I shall make the best arrangements I can and be as well prepared as possible. But still I feel good confidence that you can be protected without leaving this country. There is more ways than one to take care of you, and I believe that you can still direct in your business concerns if we are all of us prudent in the matter. If it was pleasant weather I should contrive to see you this evening, but I dare not run to much of a risk on account of so many going to see you.

Taxes due, supposed about thirty dollars. Town property one thousand dollars. Balance, Money, payable in one, two, three and four years.
